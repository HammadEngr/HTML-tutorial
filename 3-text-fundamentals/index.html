            The Paragrapg tag "p", no line breaks involved no matter how you
            formate your text while writing, so there are two solutions
          </h3>
          <h4>Solution # 01, use break rule</h4>
          <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. <br />
            Quibusdam dicta ea commodi necessitatibus incidunt amet aliquam enim

          <h4>Solution # 02, use pre tag</h4>
          <pre>
              My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 

              My Bonnie lies over the sea. 
              My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 
              Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.

        <h3>Text Formating</h3>
        <p>
          Text formatting: Modifying text appearance to enhance readability and
          visual appeal using elements like font, size, color, alignment, and
          spacing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In html there are following self closing inline tags which we can use
          to formate our text
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>BOLD</b> <br />
          <strong>STRONG</strong> <br />
          <i>ITALIC</i><br />
          <em>EMPHASIS</em><br />
          <mark>MARK</mark><br />
          <del>DELETED</del><br />
          <ins>INSERT</ins><br />
          H<sub>2</sub>O <br />
          2 <sup>2</sup> = 4

        <hr />
        <h4>Qoutations <br /></h4>
        <p>
          In HTML we can distinguish the qoutes in 2 ways. <br />
          1. Inline Qoutes <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> <br />
          2. Blockquotes <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> tag is to visully distinguish
          the qouted text which do not require a paragraph. example: Einstein
          said:
          <q>
            <b>
              If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well
              enough,</b
            >
            <br />
          </q>
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tag is to visually
          distinguish the quotes which are long enough and are in the form of
          paragraph
        </p>
        <blockquote
          cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote"
        >
          <p>
            In the labyrinth of the mind, thoughts intertwine like a complex web
            of interconnected neurons. Ideas emerge and evolve, fueled by
            curiosity and the insatiable quest for knowledge. The mind is a vast
            library, filled with the stories of countless generations, the
            wisdom of ancient civilizations, and the collective experiences of
            humanity. It is a realm where the past and the future converge,
            where memories of bygone days mingle with dreams of what is yet to
            come. It is a landscape of contradictions, where doubt battles with
            certainty, fear wrestles with courage, and despair dances with hope.
            The mind is a sanctuary, a refuge from the chaos of the external
            world, where introspection and introspection flourish. It is a place
            of solace and introspection, where we can find solace in times of
            turmoil and clarity in times of confusion. It is a source of
            resilience, where the power to overcome adversity resides. It is in
            the depths of the mind that we find the strength to endure, the
            resilience to persevere, and the courage to face the unknown. It is
            a testament to the indomitable spirit of humanity, a testament to
            our capacity for growth, transformation, and self-discovery.

        <h4>Address block</h4>
        <p>
          <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> is used to distinguish address visually
          and it also helps spiders to crawl and search easily, for example:
        </p>
        <address>
          Auther Dent <br />
          visiter@visit.com
        </address>

        <h4>cite tag</h4>
        <p>
          <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> is used for citations or references to the
          work of others. like if someone publish a paper and he has used some
          data in his paper then he will use citation to refer to that
          particular work.
